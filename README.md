CS109a Intro to Data Science Final Project

WOOFWOOFNYC / Visualizing Dogs in New York


The project aims to analyze the relationship between social and spatial factors and provide insight into the 
intangible and physical organization of the city through the perspective of dogs and their daily routines. 
It will explore socio-economic indicators such as property values, neighborhood quality, proximity to open spaces like parks, 
and walkability of the urban environment to visualize the city's spatial characteristics.

Our project is motivated by the prevalence of certain dog breeds in various neighborhoods in Cambridge and Boston, 
and we seek to explore the correlation between dogs and socioeconomic factors such as income, work-life balance, 
household size, and neighborhood quality. While we would ideally like to examine individual dog and owner characteristics, 
ethical data inquiry practices prevent us from doing so, and data limitations make it impractical. Instead, we will use zip 
code as a common feature in our data collection and analysis. To conduct our investigation, we have chosen New York City as 
our research site due to the availability of comprehensive data on dogs, people, and neighborhoods, as well as its socioeconomic 
stratification and spatial segregation. Additionally, New York City is renowned as a bustling metropolis, making it an ideal 
location to investigate the relationship between dogs and urban living.
