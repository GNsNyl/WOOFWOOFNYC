	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p class="text-col"> The project intends to infer the correlation among social and
		spatial indicators, recognize and visualize the city’s spatial
		and intangible organization through the dog’s perspective
		regarding daily routine, and the socio-economic information
		it indicates:
		- property values,
		- neighborhood quality
		- distance to open space (park), the walkability of the urban
		environment </p>
	<p class="text-col">
		Our project is inspired by our observation of dog walkers and their dogs on the street - a naive
		eyeballing of the dog breeds in different neighborhoods in Cambridge and Boston. The number
		of Goldendoodles and golden retrievers we meet on the street differs in various places. So the
		project aims to analytically and data-scientifically parse the correlation between dogs and the
		socio-economic aspects within each area.
		The argument lies in the fact that raising a dog is a costly and time-consuming act that may
		have social implications in terms of income, life-work balance, household size, neighborhood
		quality, etc.
		To actualize our query, we select New York City as a site of study for the following reasons:
		● the availability of data for dogs, people, and neighborhoods
		● the stratification and segregation of the city in terms of income, spatial quality, and
		inhabitor portrait
		● it is a famous city
		Our ideal model would be to train on the portrait of the individual dog and its owner (income,
		age, gender, marital status, occupation...) but that would be a violation of ethics of data
		inquiry, and it’s not practical for the lack of data. Instead, we use Zipcode as a common feature
		in all our data collection and proceed with our analysis with that.
	</p>

<div class="section">
	<h1>Time Series</h1>
	<p class="text-col"> Based on the time series plot on the
		left:
		● the number of dog registrations
		stays relatively stationary with a slightly
		growing trend before the year 2020;
		● there is seasonal fluctuation
		within each year. The number grows till
		September and starts to fall since then;
		● after March 2020 (the pandemic
		lockdown), the number grows far more
		rapidly than before. People started to
		work from home and look for comfort to
		get through the social silo created by
		COVID-19.</p>

	<h1>Dog Population</h1>
	<p class="text-col"> Based on the initial data analysis, we have found Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens have the
		most registered dogs. However, the Bronx and Staten Island have significantly fewer registered
		dogs. By comparing the registered dog counts with population, we have found that although
		there are significantly fewer registered dogs in the Bronx, there are only 6% population
		differences compared to Manhattan (Bronx 1,471,160; Manhattan 1,664,727).</p>
	<p class="text-col">By looking at the map, again, we have found the population of the zip code region is not
		directly correlated with the counts of registered dogs, in other words, the higher population in
		the region does not imply more dogs.
		● For instance, the Brooklyn area is more populated, but there are fewer registered dogs.
		This result is not counter-intuitive since the zoning and land use differ, and so do other
		socio-economic factors, which we will unpack later.
		● There are more registered dogs in the Manhattan region.
		● Especially the neighborhood close to Central Park.
		● In addition, people here pay more for rent and have shorter commutes.</p>

<div class="section">
	<h1>Data Science</h1>
	<p class="text-col">

		● Park Acres
		○ Park areas within each Zip Code are correlated with the dog counts. The correlation
		is in manifold ways;
		○ Dogs love parks, running around or pacing, and meeting other dogs;
		○ Park, as an urban planning element, is highly associated with zoning and residence,
		meaning there are more parks in or near a residential area and fewer in industrial
		areas;

		● 30-40 min Commute time
		○ As mentioned earlier, the area around Manhattan spends less time commuting to
		work. On average, workers from Manhattan spend around 32 min to work. In
		contrast, workers from other boroughs spend more than 40 min to work. Based on
		our earlier analysis, registered dog counts are significantly higher in the area around
		the Manhattan region. Since job density in Manhattan (Robert M.
		3
		) is much higher,
		and in addition, commute time is closely associated with the location. Therefore, the
		feature '30-40 min’ becomes a top predictor for our model.
		○ Commute Time (Bronx: 44.899 min; Brooklyn: 42.459 min; Manhattan: 31.981
		min; Queens: 44.606 min; Staten Island: 44.567 min)
		○ (see 3_dog_EDA.ipynb; 0.6 mean travel to work to work + borough )
		● Median Income
		○ Having a dog will bring extra expenses such as the dog's food cost, recurring
		medical expenses, license and so on. In addition, there are also unexpected costs,
		for instance, property damages or emergency medical care. The yearly cost of
		having a dog may range from hundreds to thousands (Heather M.). A dog will
		require the owner to be in a better economic condition than non-dog owners. In
		other words, there are associations between median income and ownership of
		dogs. On average, the median yearly income of workers from Manhattan is around
		$107,962. It is significantly higher than the ones from other boroughs. The median
		income of the Bronx is about $45,692, which is the lowest of all the boroughs. As
		mentioned earlier, the Bronx has a significantly lower number of registered dogs
		than the region's population. Considering the financial ability based on income may
		explain the reason. Therefore, ‘median income’ becomes a top predictor for our
		model.
		○ Median Income (Bronx: $45692.480; Brooklyn: $65375.919; Manhattan:
		$107961.907; Queens: $74595.250; Staten Island: $81192.833)
		○ (see 3_dog_EDA.ipynb; 0.5 income + borough)
		○ (reference: Heather M. ‘How Much Does It Cost to Have a Dog?’
		https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/dog-ownership-cost/ )</p>
	<p class="text-col"> (please refer to the notebook for hyperparameter setups)
		● response variable: dog counts within each zip code
		● predicting variables: within the range of Data Overview contents with different in each
		notebook
		Model With All Features (4.1_dog_model_with_all_features.ipynb)
		1. set our baseline model as Linear Regression without penalization;
		2. add lasso regularization to get a sense of trivial features (which will be fed in 4.2);
		3. cross-validation to determine the best degree for Polynomial Regression, the
		best_degree we get is 1;
		4. grid search cross validation to get the optimal max_depth for decision tree regressor,
		plot feature importance for EDA;
		5. bagging regressor with the decision tree from the previous step as base estimator
		6. gradient boosting with an initial setup
		7. grid search cross-validation with gradient boosting for optimal:
	a. n_estimators
	b. learning rate
	c. subsample
	d. max_depth
	<br>
		Results: we nest the optimal Gradient Boost Regressor within Ada Boost Regressor and get a better result of 0.769 test accuracy
